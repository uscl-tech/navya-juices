Summary
of
Phase
4 * Created
a
server - side
utility`getAuthenticatedUserAndRole` in `lib/supabase/server-utils.ts`
to
consistently
fetch
user
and
role
information
within
Server
Actions.
*   Refefactored `AddressForm`
to
use
a
new Server()
Action`saveAddressAction`
located in `app/account/addresses/actions.ts`.
*   The `saveAddressAction`
now
performs
role
checks, ensuring
only
admins
can
perform
admin - specific
operations
on
addresses (like using `userIdForAdmin`).
*   Updated `app/admin/products/actions.ts`
to
include
explicit
admin
role
checks
at
the
beginning
of
its
actions.This
phase
significantly
enhances
security
by
ensuring
that
backend
operations
are
gated
by
user
roles, complementing
the
database - level
RLS
policies.
